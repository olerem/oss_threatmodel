Free hardware and software implementation of Bitcoin (and other
crypto-currency) wallet, password manager, 2F auth, GPG etc.
* Yubico explaining the reasons behind their proprietary tamper-proof device
https://www.yubico.com/2016/05/secure-hardware-vs-open-source/
They explain why (in their opinion) it doesn't make any sense to build

http://no-passwd.net/askbot/question/33/how-safe-is-gnuk-against-side-channel-attacks-usb/
No sign of anyone actually trying to SCA his code
* Voltage supply line side-channel attack on Yubikey 2 in details
https://www.emsec.rub.de/media/crypto/veroeffentlichungen/2014/02/04/paper_yubikey_sca.pdf
After new firmware from Yubico the attack was no longer possible, at
least by the given hardware
